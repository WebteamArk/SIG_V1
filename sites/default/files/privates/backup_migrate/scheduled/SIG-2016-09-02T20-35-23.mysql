Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created a new game called Mintonette as a pastime to be played (preferably) indoors and by any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from tennis and handball. Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport, less rough than basketball, for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.<br />\r\nA match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each. An observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the International YMCA Training School. The game quickly became known as volleyball (it was originally spelled as two words: "volley ball"). Volleyball An international federation, the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB), was founded in 1947, and the first World Championships were held in 1949 for men and 1952 for women.<br />\r\nToday, volleyball, is a fast growing sport combining strategy, tactics, power and technical skills.</p>\r\n','filtered_html'),('paragraphs_item','intro_text','0','170','170','und','0','<p>Thank you for your question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nYou will receive a confirmation mail soon.</p>\r\n','filtered_html'),('paragraphs_item','intro_text','0','172','172','und','0','<p>Would you like to learn more about our company and our projects?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then please select the brochure(s) you would like to download here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for your download.</p>\r\n','filtered_html'),('paragraphs_item','intro_text','0','175','175','und','0','<p>The Edge is not only good for the&nbsp;environment; it also offers a healthy internal&nbsp;climate for users.

Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created a new game called Mintonette as a pastime to be played (preferably) indoors and by any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from tennis and handball. Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport, less rough than basketball, for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.<br />\r\nA match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each. An observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the International YMCA Training School. The game quickly became known as volleyball (it was originally spelled as two words: "volley ball"). Volleyball An international federation, the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB), was founded in 1947, and the first World Championships were held in 1949 for men and 1952 for women.<br />\r\nToday, volleyball, is a fast growing sport combining strategy, tactics, power and technical skills.</p>\r\n','filtered_html'),('paragraphs_item','intro_text','0','170','170','und','0','<p>Thank you for your question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nYou will receive a confirmation mail soon.</p>\r\n','filtered_html'),('paragraphs_item','intro_text','0','172','172','und','0','<p>Would you like to learn more about our company and our projects?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then please select the brochure(s) you would like to download here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for your download.</p>\r\n','filtered_html'),('paragraphs_item','intro_text','0','175','175','und','0','<p>The Edge is not only good for the&nbsp;environment; it also offers a healthy internal&nbsp;climate for users.
